This plugin adds a dictionary to your sidebar and displays words from it.

== Description ==

This widget adds a dictionary to your sidebar and displays words from it through ajax calls. 
All the words in the description are links themselves, so you can keep wandering through the 
words. If a word has no description, a small form is displayed to make one up.

It is not meant to be useful, so it has no search. You can only hope visitors will come up 
with nice, sarcastic or cryptic descriptions.

== Installation ==

= IMPORTANT! =

The previous version of this plugin (1.2.3) has been in the Plugin Directory for many years without update.

I have completely rewritten this plugin, and several things changed. If you have trouble updating it, you can delete the old version first. All the words you have in your database will NOT be deleted, so after installing this new version, you will see the same words.

And if you are still using my plugin, thank you very much. I look forward to hearing about the way you use it.

Kind regards from the Netherlands,

-- Jeroen

1. Upload the folder to wp-content/plugins/

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Hopefully, I fixed a javascript problem. This error was only found on blogs installed in a subdirectory. If 
you still encounter this error, please let me know!

== Screenshots ==

Sorry, screenshots of a dictionary is stupid.
